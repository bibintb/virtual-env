Using a Python virtual environment in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) on Windows is a good practice for Python development. The virtual environment allows you to manage dependencies for different projects separately and avoid conflicts. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up and use a Python virtual environment in VSCode for a startup development team:

Step 1: Install Python
Make sure Python is installed on your Windows system. You can download the latest version from the official Python website. During the installation, remember to select the option to add Python to PATH.

Step 2: Install VSCode
If not already installed, download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website.

Step 3: Install the Python Extension for VSCode
Open VSCode and install the official Python extension by Microsoft from the VSCode marketplace. This extension offers rich support for Python, including features like IntelliSense, linting, debugging, and code navigation.

Step 4: Create a New Project Folder
Create a project folder for the startup's application and open it in VSCode.

```
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
code .
```

Step 5: Create Virtual Environment
Open the terminal in VSCode (View -> Terminal) and execute the following command:

```
python -m venv env
```

This command creates a new virtual environment named env within your project directory. The name env can be replaced with any name you prefer for your virtual environment.

Step 6: Activate Virtual Environment
Before using the virtual environment, you need to activate it. You can do so with the following command in the VSCode terminal:

For Command Prompt:

```
env\Scripts\activate
```

For PowerShell:

```
.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Make sure to run PowerShell as an administrator if you encounter any execution policy restrictions.

Step 7: Install Packages
With the virtual environment activated, install any required packages using pip:

```
pip install package_name
```
Replace package_name with the actual name of the package you wish to install.

Step 8: Configure VSCode to Use the Virtual Environment
VSCode should automatically detect the virtual environment and select the appropriate Python interpreter. To manually select it:

Press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette.
Type Python: Select Interpreter.
Choose the interpreter that corresponds to your project's virtual environment.
Step 9: Code and Run
You can now write your Python code in VSCode, and it will run using the Python interpreter in the virtual environment.

Step 10: Deactivate Virtual Environment
Once you've finished working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by typing the following command in the terminal:

```
deactivate
```

For a startup development team, incorporating virtual environments into their workflow will ensure that each member can work on the project without affecting the system-wide Python installation or the work of others. Additionally, it simplifies dependency management and makes the project more portable and easier to set up on other machines, which is beneficial for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.
